# Open Source Guild

Welcome to the OssGuild! Think of this community as a safe space to share your struggle with the vast and twirling world of Open Source. We know how crazy exploring that wild could be and the toll it exerts on mortals like you and I. We hope (and well, belive) this community would serve you and help quench all your thirst and travails with all things regarding open source. Welcome and feel free to explore.

## Open Applications
Like all things wonderful, we need to share this good news with newer communites in the world. To do that, we need super people who are ready to serve and create paths for the community to follow. If that's you, watch out for this space. Applications Open Soon.
